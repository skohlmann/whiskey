# Whiskey In The Jar

As I was going over<br />
The Cork and Kerry mountains<br />
I saw Captain Farrell<br />
And his money he was counting<br />
I first produced my pistol<br />
And then produced my rapier<br />
I said "Stand and deliver<br />
Or the devil he may take you"
 
I took all of his money<br />
And it was a pretty penny<br />
I took all of his money and<br />
I brought it home to Molly<br />
She swore that she'd love me<br />
No Never would she leave me<br />
But the devil take that woman<br />
For you know she treat me easy
 
Mush a ring dum a doo dum a da<br />
Whack for my daddy'o<br />
Whack for my daddy'o,<br />
There's Whiskey in the jar, o
 
Being drunk and weary<br />
I went to Molly`s chamber<br />
Taking my Molly with me<br />
And I never knew the danger<br />
For about six or maybe seven<br />
In walked Captain Farrell<br />
I jumped up, fired off my pistols<br />
And I shot him with both barrels
 
Mush a ring dum a doo dum a da<br />
Whack for my daddy'o<br />
Whack for my daddy'o,<br />
There's Whiskey in the jar, o
 
Now some men like the fishing<br />
And some men like fowling<br />
And some men like to hear<br />
The cannonballs are roaring<br />
Me - I like sleeping<br />
Specially in my Molly's chamber<br />
But here I am in prison,<br />
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah
